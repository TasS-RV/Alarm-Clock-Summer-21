# Alarm-Clock-Summer-21
Project to create a programmable Alarm clock using on the Arduino Nano platform, with Alarm functionality. 

The clock is mostly self explanatory, with different sequence of button presses and holds cthat can be used to switch between modes of operation.

This includes:
1) Standard time display.
2) Alarm mode.
3) Stopwatch mode.

The alarm mode can also be toggled on and off, ssuch that the clok can override the alarm without triggering the sound sequence. It uses a 7 segment LED array with multiplexing to later the value of small segment sequentially. 

Video demos are vaialble at:

Some images of the circuit development through the process are also found.

Please note that running this code is futile without the circuit assembled, therefore is primarily for review purposes.
