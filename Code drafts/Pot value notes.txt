Analogue readings form the potentiometer can be printed onto the Serial monitor at a 9600 baud rate to calibrate the rate of time adjustment. The analogue values 
from 0-1023 using a 10-bit buffer are described below.

990-1010 will be the default range of values - 

650 and 1023 at the lower and upper limits
At the extreme ends: >1022 and <660 will be  the fastest rate (for rapidly counting up before the rate can be reduced)

990-value/ 990-650 for the proportion of time:
then the range will differ from 200-410millisec

Otherwise about 6-7 milli sec for the full countup to 90 mins
